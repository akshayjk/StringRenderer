Here is the backend  process

1. Validate the xml received
2. Decide the tags, Decide the actions
3. Write the parser for '{{}}'
4. Write the rendering rules
5. Strategy for the inclusion of new functions/actions/tags



The bigger object which can have multiple inner objects --> inner element can be an object or a string

it will be object
    1. if more inner tags
    2. property tags


Aim:

1. Should render the strings in nested fashion
2. Should process certain tags such as "sort inc", "sort dec", action="repeat"
3. Should create directories and files with dynamic names and structure
4. Should be able to edit the previous content -- ??

<renderFile>
	<div  >This is the first Line <div repeat="MetaJSON.META_TABLE">This is another line</div></div>
        <div>this is the second line </div>
        <div repeat="true">This is the third line </div>

</renderFile>
