get the xml data convert to the object;
from object convert to mustache

Aim is to produce one of the files in the client SDK from the meta JSON present


process is as follows :
1. Get the XML with limited specific tags
2. Then convert the xml into the JSON format
    error handling --> invalid json and improper tags/ unknown tags
3. Build the mustache script  --> script for mustache rendering -- that has problems for generating the rendering script

Best way is to make our own script for identifying the names in double braces



For Object if the data model is the object its easy to render the string -- > wrote the function for the same


For  the Array
