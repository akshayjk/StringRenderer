Here is the backend  process

1. Validate the xml received
2. Decide the tags, Decide the actions
3. Write the parser for '{{}}'
4. Write the rendering rules
5. Strategy for the inclusion of new functions/actions/tags



The bigger object which can have multiple inner objects --> inner element can be an object or a string

it will be object
    1. if more inner tags
    2. property tags

1. Should render the strings in nested fashion
2. Should process certain tags such as "sort inc", "sort dec", action="repeat"
3. Should create directories and files with dynamic names and structure
4. Should be able to edit the previous content -- ??
