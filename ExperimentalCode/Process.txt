Object :
#OuterMost object will never be an array since there is no possibility that it will repeat
    1. Take an object --> which will be most probably the array
    2. The array has either string(if there is no Class/Action Tag) and will be an object
    if it has Class/Action Tag or any inner Object
    3. currently we dnt have position --> we assume that child object is always be at the end
    4. Any object may or may not have the "_" tag
    5. for an object, if there are no colleague objects or class object
    then it will be a pain string other wise it would be an object and string will be in "_"




fetch the object
    always outer object --> there should be single key (can be outerMost or renderFile tag)
        get the value of outerObject key --> this is where each key would be array (always)
            loop through the array --> get one object
                Fetch an OBJECT
                    if(string)--> means just a string --> print string
                    else if(Object)--> may have class/string/child objects

function RENDER
finalString =''
for arrayElement till Array end

    pass through the Action tag operators to get the Data Model and Conditions
    if(type-string)
        finalString += PrintString(arrayElement)
    else if(type - object)--> will have classes --> model, model operations, conditions
       finalStringObject =''
           if(childObjects)
                finalStringObject += RENDER(ChildObject)
                if(string is present)
                    finalStringObject = PrintString(string, DataModel, finalStringObject);
           else --> no child present
                finalRenderObject =  PrintString(string)






PrintString(String, DataModel, StringrToAdd, condition){
    var StringToReturn=''
    for each element in dataModel
        evaluate Condition
            if holds
                StringToReturn = regexMatch + StringToAdd
